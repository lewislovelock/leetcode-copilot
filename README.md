# 🚀 LeetCode Copilot 🚀


Welcome to my LeetCode Copilot repository! This is where I store my journey of learning and problem-solving on LeetCode, with the help of GitHub Copilot.

## 📚 Languages

Currently, this repository contains solutions in:

- 🐍 Python
- 🦀 Rust (which I'm currently learning)
- 🌐 Go (depends on my mood🤗)

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Solutions

### Python

To run a Python solution, use the following command:

```shell
python <solution>.py
```
  
Each Python solution comes with its own test cases. To run these tests, use:

```shell
python -m doctest -v <solution>.py
```

### Rust

To run a Rust solution, navigate to the `rust_solution` directory under each problem directory and use:

```shell
rustc main.rs
./main
```

To run the tests for a Rust solution, use:

```shell
cargo init
cargo test
```

Happy coding! 🎉
