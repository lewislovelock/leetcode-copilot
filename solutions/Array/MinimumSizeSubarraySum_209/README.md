# Intuition

Given an array of positive integers and a target value, we need to find the smallest subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target. This problem can be solved using the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window of elements that add up to a sum less than the target, and then continuously adjust this window to find the smallest possible subarray that meets the condition.

## Approach

We initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start of the array and a variable sum to keep track of the sum of elements between left and right. We then start moving the right pointer to the right, adding the right element to sum. When sum becomes greater than or equal to the target, we update our result with the minimum length of the current window (i.e., right - left + 1). We then subtract the left element from sum and move the left pointer to the right. This process continues until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n). Each element in the array is visited at most twice, once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer.
- Space complexity: O(1). We only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the sum.

## Code

```py
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        """
        >>> s = Solution()
        >>> s.minSubArrayLen([2,3,1,2,4,3], 7)
        2
        >>> s.minSubArrayLen([1,2,3,4,5], 15)
        5
        >>> s.minSubArrayLen([1,2,3,4,5], 11)
        3
        >>> s.minSubArrayLen([1,2,3,4,5], 100)
        0
        """
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 0: return 0

        left, right = 0, 0
        sum = 0
        ans = n + 1
        while right < n:
            sum += nums[right]
            while sum >= target:
                ans = min(ans, right - left + 1)
                sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            right += 1

        return 0 if ans == n + 1 else ans
```
